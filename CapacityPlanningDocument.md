## AWS Capacity Planning Document for clearview System

### 1. **Objective**
This document outlines the AWS-based capacity planning for the [Service Name], which will handle 100 concurrent users with scalability to support a total user base of 1 million users. The focus is on resource estimation, AWS service selection, and scalability strategies.

### 2. **Overview of the Service**
- **Service Name**: [Service Name]
- **Functionality**: [Brief description of the service’s core functionality].
- **AWS Deployment Environment**: [e.g., EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, etc.].
- **Dependencies**: [e.g., Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, S3, external APIs].

### 3. **Workload Estimation**
#### 3.1 **Concurrent Users**
- **Concurrent users**: 100 at any given time.
- **Average session duration**: [e.g., 10 minutes].
- **Expected requests per user**: [e.g., 10 requests/session].
- **Requests per second (RPS)**:
  - 100 concurrent users × 10 requests/session ÷ 600 seconds ≈ **1.67 RPS** on average.

#### 3.2 **Total Users**
- **Total registered users**: 1 million.
- **Active user percentage**: [e.g., 10% daily active users].
- **Daily active users (DAU)**: 1 million × 10% = **100,000 active users**.
- **Peak daily load**: Assume 5-10% of active users online simultaneously during peak.
  - 5% of DAU = 5,000 peak concurrent users.

#### 3.3 **Traffic Estimate**
- **Average request size**: [e.g., 5 KB].
- **Average response size**: [e.g., 15 KB].
- **Data volume**:
  - **In (requests)**: 1.67 RPS × 5 KB = 8.35 KB/s.
  - **Out (responses)**: 1.67 RPS × 15 KB = 25.05 KB/s.
  - **Peak throughput** (5% active at peak, ~5,000 users):
    - **Request rate**: ~83 RPS.
    - **Request data**: 83 RPS × 5 KB = 415 KB/s.
    - **Response data**: 83 RPS × 15 KB = 1.25 MB/s.
    - Total peak throughput ≈ **1.67 MB/s**.

### 4. **AWS Resource Requirements**
#### 4.1 **Compute Resources**
- **EC2 Instance Type**:
  - Start with **t3.medium** instances for general-purpose workloads.
  - **t3.medium**: 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM (baseline).
  - Initial setup: 2-4 instances to handle 100 concurrent users.

- **Auto-scaling Group**:
  - Use **AWS Auto Scaling** to manage additional capacity for peak load.
  - Auto-scale based on **CPU utilization** (e.g., scale when CPU > 75%) or **RPS** (1.67 RPS baseline, ~83 RPS at peak).
  - Scaling to handle **5,000 peak concurrent users**: 
    - Each **t3.medium** can handle 50-70 users, so around **70-100 instances** at peak times.

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:
  - Use **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic among EC2 instances.
  - Enable **sticky sessions** if necessary, or handle session state with **Amazon ElastiCache**.

#### 4.2 **Memory Requirements**
- **Memory for concurrent users**:
  - 100 concurrent users × 100 MB = **10 GB of RAM**.
  - Each **t3.medium** instance has 4 GB of RAM, so 2-4 instances should suffice for 100 concurrent users.
- **Memory for peak load**:
  - 5,000 concurrent users × 100 MB = **500 GB of RAM**, requiring **approximately 125 instances** (4 GB each) at peak load.

#### 4.3 **Storage Requirements**
- **Database**:
  - **Amazon RDS (Relational)**: Use for structured data, supporting **1 million users**.
    - Assume **50 KB/user** for profile data → 1 million users × 50 KB = **50 GB**.
    - Select an **RDS instance type** (e.g., db.m5.large: 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM).
    - Consider **Aurora** for auto-scaling capabilities.

  - **Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL)**: If the application uses NoSQL data storage, use **DynamoDB** for scalability. Configure **read/write capacity units (RCUs/WCUs)** based on workload.

- **Object Storage**:
  - Use **Amazon S3** for static files (user uploads, media, etc.).
  - Estimate storage based on file size and volume, e.g., 1 TB of media storage.
  - S3 supports **multi-region replication** for redundancy.

- **Cache**:
  - Use **Amazon ElastiCache (Redis or Memcached)** to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions, API results).
  - Initial sizing: ~500 MB for 100 concurrent user sessions.

#### 4.4 **Network Requirements**
- **Bandwidth**:
  - **Inbound**: 8.35 KB/s (average).
  - **Outbound**: 25.05 KB/s (average).
  - Peak throughput ≈ **1.67 MB/s** (for 5,000 peak users).
- **AWS VPC**:
  - Set up a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** with public subnets for web traffic and private subnets for the database and internal services.
  - Ensure **Network Load Balancers (NLB)** or **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** handle network distribution.

### 5. **Scalability**
#### 5.1 **Auto Scaling**
- Use **AWS Auto Scaling** groups for EC2 instances:
  - Scale out when CPU utilization exceeds 75%.
  - Scale in when utilization drops below 30%.
  - Plan for **50-70 instances** during peak load for 5,000 concurrent users.

#### 5.2 **Serverless Options**
- Consider **AWS Lambda** for stateless workloads or periodic tasks. It automatically scales based on demand and can reduce costs for certain operations.
  
- Use **Amazon API Gateway** to interface between the front end and backend services (EC2, Lambda, etc.).

### 6. **High Availability and Redundancy**
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**:
  - Deploy **EC2 instances**, **RDS**, and **ElastiCache** across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
  - Use **Route 53** for global DNS failover and routing.

- **Load Balancing**:
  - Distribute traffic with **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**, depending on the application’s needs.
  - Enable **cross-zone load balancing** for improved redundancy.

- **Data Backup**:
  - Enable **RDS backups** with automated backups and snapshots.
  - Use **Amazon S3** versioning and lifecycle rules for static file backups.

### 7. **Monitoring and Alerting**
#### 7.1 **Monitoring Tools**
- **Amazon CloudWatch**:
  - Monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network throughput, and latency.
  - Set up **custom CloudWatch metrics** for tracking RPS, error rates, and performance.
  
- **AWS X-Ray**:
  - Use for distributed tracing and identifying performance bottlenecks in microservices architecture.

#### 7.2 **Key Metrics**:
- CPU and memory utilization on EC2 instances.
- Network traffic in/out (bytes).
- **RDS/DynamoDB** throughput and latency.
- Cache hit ratio (ElastiCache).
- S3 storage utilization.

#### 7.3 **Alerts**:
- Set CloudWatch alerts for:
  - CPU usage > 75%.
  - Memory usage > 80%.
  - RPS exceeding expected thresholds.
  - Latency exceeding 300 ms.
  - 4xx/5xx error rates.

### 8. **Traffic Patterns and Growth**
- **Expected growth**: 10-20% increase in traffic month-over-month as user adoption grows.
- **Capacity buffer**: Maintain a 20% buffer to handle unexpected traffic spikes or user growth.
- **Seasonality**: Monitor traffic surges due to specific events (e.g., product launches, holiday sales).

### 9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**
- **Database backups**:
  - Configure **RDS automated backups** with point-in-time recovery.
  - Enable cross-region snapshots for disaster recovery.
  
- **S3 backups**: Use **cross-region replication** for high-availability and data redundancy.
  
- **Disaster recovery plan**:
  - **RPO**: 1 hour.
  - **RTO**: 2 hours.
  - Regularly test failover procedures and backups.

### 10. **Cost Estimation**
- **EC2 costs**:
  - **On-demand** or **reserved instances** depending on workload predictability.
  - Estimate EC2 cost based on **
